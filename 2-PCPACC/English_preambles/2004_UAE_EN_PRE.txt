Preamble We, the Rulers of the Emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain, Ras al Khaimah and Fujairah; Whereas it is our desire and the desire of the people of our Emirates to establish a Union between these Emirates, to promote a better life, more enduring stability and a higher international status for the Emirates and their people; Desiring to create closer links between the Arab Emirates in the form of an independent, sovereign, federal state, capable of protecting its existence and the existence of its members, in cooperation with the sister Arab states and with all other friendly states which are members of the United Nations Organisation and members of the family of nations in general, on a basis of mutual respect and reciprocal interests and advantage; Desiring also to lay the foundations of Union Law in the coming years on a sound basis, corresponding with the realities and the capacities of the Emirates at the present time, enabling the Union, so far as possible, freely to achieve its goals, sustaining the identity of its members where this is not inconsistent with those goals and preparing the people of the Union at the same time for a noble and free constitutional life, progressing by steps towards a comprehensive, representative, democratic regime in an Islamic and Arab society free from fear and anxiety; And whereas the realisation of the foregoing was our greatest desire, towards which we have bent our strongest resolution, being desirous of advancing our country and our people to the position which befits them and which will restore to them their appropriate place among civilised states and nations; For all these reasons and in order that the preparation of the permanent constitution for the Union may be completed, we proclaim before the Supreme and Omnipotent Creator, and before all people our agreement to this provisional Constitution, to which our signatures were appended, which shall be implemented during the transitional period indicated in it; May Allah, our best Protector and Defender, grant us success.
