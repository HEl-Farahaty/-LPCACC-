However, priority of debate shall always be given to bills and proposals put forward by the Government.</align> <align>Article 82 If the Consultative Council does not approve a bill passed by the Chamber of Deputies, whether the Consultative Council’s decision involves rejection, amendment, deletion or addition, the President of the Council shall return it to the Chamber of Deputies for reconsideration.</align> <align>Article 83 If the Chamber of Deputies accepts the bill as it receives it from the Consultative Council, the President of the Consultative Council shall refer it to the Prime Minister who will submit it to the King.</align> <align>Article 84 The Chamber of Deputies may reject any amendment made to a bill by the Consultative Council, and may insist on its previous decision without introducing any new amendments to the bill.

The membership of a member of the Consultative Council or Chamber of Deputies may also be abrogated for loss of confidence or esteem or for being in breach of the duties of membership. A decision to abrogate membership must secure a two-thirds majority of the members of the chamber of which he is a member. If taken by the Consultative Council, the decision shall be submitted to the King for approval.</align> <align>Article 100 Members of the Consultative Council and Chamber of Deputies shall not be awarded medals or decorations during their term of membership.</align> <align>Part 4 Provisions on the Convening of the National Assembly</align> <align>Article 101 In addition to the occasions when both chambers of Consultative Council and Chamber of Deputies, that is the National Assembly, convene as a congress under the Constitution, the King may call such a meeting of his own initiative or at the request of the Prime Minister.</align> <align>Article 102 The joint National Assembly meeting shall be chaired respectively by the President of the Consultative Council, or in his absence by the President of the Chamber of Deputies, followed by the First Vice-President of the Consultative Council, followed by the First Vice-President of the Chamber of Deputies.</align> <align>Article 103 In the cases other than those in which the Constitution requires a special majority, joint sessions of the two chambers of the National Assembly shall not be deemed legally valid unless they are attended by the majority of the members of each individual chamber.

No authority shall prevail over the judgment of a judge, and under no circumstances may the course of justice be interfered with. The law guarantees the independence of the judiciary, and the law shall lay down the guarantees of judges and the provisions pertaining to them. The law shall lay down the provisions pertaining to the Public Prosecution Office, the tasks of the office for delivery of formal legal opinions, the preparation of legislation, State representation before the law, and personnel employed on such matters. The provisions governing advocacy shall be regulated by law.</align> <align>Article 105 The various types and degrees of the courts shall be regulated by law, and the law shall state their functions and jurisdiction.

It does not extend to other persons except when martial law is declared and within the bounds prescribed by law. Court hearings shall be held in public except in exceptional cases prescribed by law. A Higher Judicial Council shall be established by law to supervise the smooth running of work in the courts and their supporting organs. The powers of the Higher Judicial Council in the functional affairs of judicial personnel and the Public Prosecution Office shall be prescribed by law.</align> <align>Article 106 A Constitutional Court shall be established, and shall comprise a President and six members, all of whom are appointed by a Royal Order for a period specified by the law. The court’s area of competence is to watch over the constitutionality of laws and statutes. The law shall state the regulations that ensure that the members of the Court are not liable to dismissal, and specifies the procedures that are followed before the Court. The law shall guarantee the right of the Government, Consultative Council, the Chamber of Deputies and notable individuals and others to challenge before the Court the constitutionality of laws and statutes. A ruling by the Court that a text in a law or a statute is unconstitutional shall have a direct effect, unless the Court specifies a subsequent date for the purpose. Thus if the Court’s rule on unconstitutionality is related to a text in the penal code then the convictions made on the basis of such a text are deemed null and void. The King may refer to the Court any draft laws before they are adopted to determine the extent of their agreement with the Constitution. The Court’s determination is binding on all State authorities and on everyone.</align> <align>Chapter V Financial Affairs</align> <align>Article 107 Public taxes shall only be established, amended and abolished by law, and persons shall only be exempted from paying them wholly or in part in those cases prescribed by law.

Any amendment can be introduced into the budget with the agreement of the Government. The budget shall be debated on the basis of the classification of its contents. The budget may be prepared for more than one financial year. No public revenue may be allocated for a particular expenditure except by law. The State general budget shall be promulgated by law. If the Budget Law is not promulgated before the beginning of the financial year, the previous budget shall be adhered to until the law’s promulgation, and revenue shall be collected and expenditure disbursed in accordance with the laws in force at the end of that year. Under no circumstances may the maximum estimates of expenditure stated in the Budget Law and laws in amendment thereof be exceeded.</align> <align>Article 110 Any disbursement which is ex-budget or in excess of the budget estimates must be made by operation of law.</align> <align>Article 111 a. Particular sums of money may be allocated to more than one financial year by law if the nature of the disbursement so requires.

It shall assist the Government and the Chamber of Deputies in controlling the collection of State revenues and the disbursement of its expenditure within the budget limits. The Office shall submit an annual report on its business, with its observations, to both the Government and the Chamber of Deputies.</align> <align>Article 117 a. Any commitment to exploit a natural resource or a public utility shall be only by operation of law and for a limited time.
